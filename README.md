I have decided to pull out my old VB Source code to share

This project was my baby many many years ago in the time of MSN Chat

It wont work against MSN anymore as its long gone but might still be useful as it still shows how I did lots of the things I did.

If I have missed any files please let me know

Enjoy

Comments welcome
